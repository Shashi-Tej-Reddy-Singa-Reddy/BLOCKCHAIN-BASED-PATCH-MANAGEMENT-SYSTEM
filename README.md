# BLOCKCHAIN-BASED-PATCH-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
Designing a robust and dependable approach for delivering patch releases to applications.By harnessing the capabilities of blockchain technology, a steadfast solution can be formulated that not only upholds the integrity and security of patches but also enhances their reliability.


Technological Stack : 
                    Blockchain
                    MongoDB
                    Ganache
                    ReactJS
                    Solidity
                    Node Js
                    Express
                    web 3 (IPFS)

Solidity : The project aims to utilize Solidity for implementing the aforementioned solution, 
           developing smart contracts that store patch information as blocks on the Ethereum blockchain network.

Ganache : It provides a simple user interface for managing a local blockchain, allowing 
          developers to easily create and manage Ethereum accounts, deploy smart contracts, and interact with the blockchain. It comes with a built-in Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and supports the Web3 API, which enables developers to interact with smart contracts and the Ethereum network using a variety of programming languages.

WEB 3 : Additionally, the project addresses the scalability concern of storing large files on the 
        blockchain by utilizing web3storage, a solution built on top of the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) and Ethereum blockchain.

Comprehending Patch Management : 
            The conventional approach to identifying, testing, and implementing software updates, aimed at enhancing security and performance, is frequently hindered by deficiencies in both transparency and security within traditional patch management methodologies.
